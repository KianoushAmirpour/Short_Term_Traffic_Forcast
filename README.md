### Challenge Definition
This challenge is about to building models for short term traffic prediction. Given the data of one hour, we are asked to predict the  
traffic in the next 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. 

The challenge and the data belong to [IARAI](https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/2021-competition/). You can find more information [here](https://github.com/iarai/NeurIPS2021-traffic4cast).


## two types of experiments: 1: fixed architecture and 2: different architeucture
## what is the problem?
## setup, usage,
## my approches, my models
